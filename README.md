# EC601_PROJECT
Soccer Offside Detection
Product Name: 

     Soccer Offside Detection System
     
Mission Definition:

     Automatically detecting offside from game videos with visual based tools
     
Target Customer: 

     Soccer referees or football associations
     

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline

Sprint1(9/10 - 9/25): establish our mission and user stories

Sprint2(9/26 - 10/06): review and investigate background ,look for algorithms for tracking.

Sprint3(10/07 - 11/10): build a classifier for a soccer ball.combine to get the best classifier

Sprint4(11/11 - 12/13): run the whole code together and track all the necessary parts.write the algorith to detect the offside based on the detections.



track_game.py is based on:

            https://towardsdatascience.com/analyse-a-soccer-game-using-tensorflow-object-detection-and-opencv-e321c230e8f2
            
we are trcking only persons and soccer ball objects and then use opencv to identify between 2 teams.

track_game is using soccer_small.mp4 video.

in order to run download all the repository and run track_game.py.
